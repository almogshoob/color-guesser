        <p>
          HSL is an intuitive color model based on Hue, Saturation and
          Lightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hue is measured in degrees on a color wheel, from red (0째) to green
          (120째) to blue (240째) back to red (360째). Saturation and Lightness are
          measured in percentages and indicate color intensity and brightness
          respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will have 5 tries to correctly guess the hsl code of the target
          color. After each guess, your last guess will be displayed in the
          guess box.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be symbols that pop up in the guesses section that indicate
          the closeness of your guess. Use these to gauge your next guess!
